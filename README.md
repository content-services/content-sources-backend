# Content Sources

## What is it?
Content Sources is an application for storing information about external content (currently YUM repositories) in a central location as well as creating snapshots of those repositories, backed by a Pulp server.


## Developing

### Requirements:

1. podman & podman-compose installed or docker & docker-compose installed (and docker running)
   - This is used to start a set of containers that are dependencies for content-sources-backend
2. yaml2json tool installed (`pip install json2yaml`).

### Create your configuration

Create a config file from the example:

  ```sh
  $ cp ./configs/config.yaml.example ./configs/config.yaml
  ```

### Build needed kafka container

  ```sh
  $ make compose-build
  ```

### Start dependency containers

  ```sh
  $ make compose-up
  ```

### Run the server!

  ```sh
  $ make run
  ```

###

Hit the API:

```sh
  $ curl -H "$( ./scripts/header.sh 9999 1111 )" http://localhost:8000/api/content-sources/v1.0/repositories/
  ```

### Stop dependency containers
When its time to shut down the running containers:

  ```sh
  $ make compose-down
  ```

And clean the volume that it uses by (this stops the container before doing it if it were running):

  ```sh
  $ make compose-clean
  ```

> There are other make rules that could be helpful, run `make help` to list them.  Some are highlighted below


### Database Commands
Migrate the Database

```sh
$ make db-migrate-up
```


Seed the database

```sh
$ make db-migrate-seed
```

Get an interactive shell:

  ```sh
  $ make db-shell
  ```

Or open directly a postgres client by running:

```sh
$ make db-cli-connect
```

### Kafka commands

You can open an interactive shell by:

```sh
$ make kafka-shell
```

You can run kafka-console-consumer.sh using `KAFKA_TOPIC` by:

```sh
$ make kafka-topic-consume KAFKA_TOPIC=my-kafka-topic
$ make kafka-topic-consume # Use the first topic at KAFKA_TOPICS list
```

> There are other make rules that could be helpful,
> run `make help` to list them.

### Start / Stop prometheus

Create the configuration for prometheus, getting started with the example one.

Update the `configs/prometheus.yaml` file to set your hostname instead of `localhost` at `scrape_configs.job_name.targets`:

```sh
# Note that the targets object cannot reference localhost, it needs the name of your host where
# the prometheus container is executed.
$ cat ./configs/prometheus.example.yaml | sed "s/localhost/$(hostname)/g" > ./configs/prometheus.yaml
```


To start prometheus run:

```sh
$ make prometheus-up
```

To stop prometheus container run:

```sh
$ make prometheus-down
```

To open the prometheus web UI, once the container is up, run the below:

```sh
$ make prometheus-ui
```

### Start / Stop mock for rbac

**Configuration requirements**

- To use this you need to enable RBAC into `config/configs.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  clients:
    rbac_enabled: True
    rbac_base_url: http://localhost:8800/api/rbac/v1
    rbac_timeout: 30
  mocks:
    rbac:
      user_read_write: ["jdoe@example.com","jdoe"]
      user_read: ["tdoe@example.com","tdoe"]
  ```

**Running it**

- Run the application by: `make run` or `./release/content-sources api consumer instrumentation mock_rbac`.
- Make some request using: `./scripts/header.sh 12345 jdoe@example.com` for admin or `./scripts/header.sh 12345 tdoe@example.com` for viewer.

> RBAC mock service is started for `make run`
> To use it running directly the service: `./release/content-sources api consumer instrumentation mock_rbac`
> Add the option `mock_rbac`

### Migrate your database (and seed it if desired)

```sh
$ make db-migrate-up
```

```sh
$ make db-migrate-seed
```

### Run the server!

```sh
$ make run
```

###

Hit the API:

```sh
$ curl -H "$( ./scripts/header.sh 9999 1111 )" http://localhost:8000/api/content-sources/v1.0/repositories/
```

### Generating new openapi docs:

```sh
$ make openapi
```

### Configuration

The default configuration file in ./configs/config.yaml.example shows all available config options.  Any of these can be overridden with an environment variable.  For example  "database.name" can be passed in via an environment variable named "DATABASE_NAME".

### Linting

To use golangci-lint:
1. `make install-golangci-lint`
2. `make lint`

To use pre-commit linter: `make install-pre-commit`
